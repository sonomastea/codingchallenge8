In this coding challenge we begin with a HTML code to host a code for the registration form of a event. We then add onto the html to include inputs and dropdowns for name, email, event date, and meal preference. Then we make a script for java that provides form validation so parts of the form don't go unanswered before sumbitting and instead displays an error message instructing the user to fill out all the fields. Lastly we implented elements in the display that show all of the outputs from a user filling out the form. This challenege was similar to the last and was challenging.
